            Welcome to our 2024-2025 Year in Review! The Chicago Network is
            unlike any other organization in the country. We are a powerful
            community of senior women leaders, all dedicated to one purpose:
            empowering women to lead.<br /><br />One of our greatest strengths –
            and a hallmark of our impact – is our powerful diversity. Our
            network brings together women from a wide array of industries,
            backgrounds, and perspectives. This vibrant mix makes us stronger,
            drives our innovation, and sets us apart as a catalyst for
            change.<br /><br />This year, we have elevated our members and their
            communities in so many ways. We have increased the number of women
            on boards, expanded the pool of qualified candidates, built new
            partnerships, and strengthened our visibility locally and
            globally.<br /><br />The Chicago Network also continues to serve as
            a thought leader on women in leadership – sparking conversation,
            shaping best practices, and influencing progress well beyond our
            membership. Our voice carries weight, and we work intentionally to
            move the needle not only in Chicago, but nationally.<br /><br />One
            highlight is our Launchpad Women’s Leadership Summit, which offers a
            truly unique opportunity for emerging women leaders. It is a space
            for targeted professional development and building a network of
            peers at similar leadership levels. It embodies our belief in
            lifting others as you climb – paying it forward so that the next
            generation of women can thrive.<br /><br />What makes us truly
            unique is that everything we do is driven by the passion and
            strength of our members. We are excited about the future, and we
            can’t wait to share more with you.

          spiel="This year’s Women in the Forefront Luncheon was nothing short of spectacular!  The atmosphere was absolutely electric as we welcomed our keynote speaker, the phenomenal Cady Coleman, a former NASA Astronaut and a retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, who captivated us with her incredible leadership journey which included spending over 180 days in space!  The energy soared as she sat down with the dynamic Michelle Miller, co-host of CBS Saturday Morning, for a conversation that left everyone inspired and empowered.  We were absolutely thrilled to have hometown CBS News Chicago anchor Maria Saavedra, grace the stage as our lively emcee. The room was packed with nearly 1,500 in-person attendees, and the excitement extended to over 200 virtual participants tuning in from across the globe.  And let’s not forget our over 125 sponsors who helped make this event a truly unforgettable celebration of women in leadership.  The energy was contagious, the stories were awe-inspiring, and the sense of community was stronger than ever – we can’t wait to see what next year brings!"

          spiel="The Women on Boards initiative stands at the heart of The Chicago Network’s commitment to advancing women’s leadership at the highest levels.  Designed as a comprehensive strategy, the initiative combines visibility, development, and connection to drive real progress in securing boards seats for women. <a href='https://womenlead.io'>Womenlead.io</a>, our publicly accessible, searchable database features over 100 accomplished leaders.  It has become a premier resource for organizations seeking top-tier board talent, with board opportunities secured through our organization.<br /><br />Yet the initiative extends far beyond the database.  Over the past year, we have delivered robust programming to prepare members for board service, fostered high-impact networking to build critical connections, and strengthened partnerships with leading organizations to expand opportunities and community.  Together these efforts are creating lasting change, ensuring that women are not only board-ready, but also positioned to make immediate and meaningful contributions as directors.

          spiel="The Chicago Network’s Launchpad Women’s Leadership Summit brought together 200 participants and eleven key sponsors at the University Club of Chicago in September.  Since its inception in 2014, Launchpad has established itself as a key platform for emerging women leaders to take charge of their own professional development.  The summit emphasizes the importance of women owning their growth by providing high-level content and actionable leadership tools designed to help women achieve their career objectives.<br />
          Attendee feedback highlighted the Summit’s value and its impact:
          <blockquote>“The topics were very relatable to my career and the people that I work with.  I was able to take something away from each of them.”</blockquote>
          <blockquote>“Appreciated the mix of lecture and small group discussions at our table, it was the perfect balance, and the sessions were so engaging the time just flew by.”</blockquote>
          <blockquote>“The quality of the people in the room.”</blockquote>
          <blockquote>“It is great to have dedicated time to focus on leadership and discussion with other leaders.  It’s brainstorming and reflection that helps center you in the kind of professional you want to be, among the chaos of the day-to-day work.”</blockquote>
          This year’s event showcased a dynamic lineup of speakers, including Carol Fitzgibbons, Director in the Leadership Acceleration Practice of Bravanti, Jackie Gnepp, Ph.D., President and Founding Partner, Humanly Possible, Inc, and Ellen Taaffe, Kellogg Professor, board director, and author, who shared their expertise and experiences. With a half-day of inspiring speakers, leadership development programs, and a networking luncheon, Launchpad is an invaluable opportunity for women to proactively recognize and develop their potential as future senior executive leaders."

Ensuring progress toward an equitable workplace, while being mindful of the broader climate, is more important than ever. It is well-documented that having women at the table in senior executive roles greatly contributed to organizational success, whether in profitability, innovation, or the long-term sustainability of values-based leadership.
